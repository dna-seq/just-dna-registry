"""Move answered sections from the inbox document into the history file.

Step 4 of docs/CONSUMER_TRIAGE_LOOP.md, as a tool rather than a careful copy-paste, because the one
property that matters is easy to break by hand: the reporter's prose must move **byte-for-byte**. The
move is verified rather than trusted — each section's fingerprint is computed before and after, and the
write is refused if any of them changed.

It verifies the *move*, not the *verdict*: an item the ledger still calls `new` archives without
complaint. Run the ledger against the history file afterwards — a well-formed archived item reads
`current` there, so a `new` or `unmarked-reply` means something was archived unanswered.

A section is moved together with its group heading and dateline when the history file is not already
under that group. A group whose items split across the two files therefore keeps its dateline in both,
which is the documented shape.

The contents line is deliberately NOT written: naming what an item was and how it ended is editorial,
and a generated line would be a worse version of the thing the index exists for.

Configuration (environment, all optional): INBOX, HISTORY, PREFIX — as for triage-state.py, and the
same repo-local defaults.

Python, and named `.py` for it: run it, or pass it to `python3` — never to `bash`. Under bash the
shebang is ignored, this docstring is executed as commands, and `import os` reaches ImageMagick's
`import`. See the extension gotcha in docs/CONSUMER_TRIAGE_LOOP.md §5.

    **A document's own title is not a group heading**, and conflating the two was a real bug that hit
    twice before anyone noticed. A section filed under no group — the normal shape once the split keeps
    the inbox empty, since someone appending a single report writes no group heading — took the inbox's
    `# <title>` *and its whole preamble* into the history file as that item's heading, because the last
    `# ` before the section is the document title and its span runs to the next `##`.

    **The fingerprint check cannot catch this**, which is why it survived: fingerprints cover the
    reporter's prose alone, so the move verifies clean while the history file grows duplicate front
    matter.

    It does **not** disturb the section above the injection, and an earlier version of this docstring
    said it did — the heading is separated by one blank line and `fingerprint()` ends in `.strip()`, so
    the preceding hash is unaffected. TRIAGE_LOOP.md § 5 had the correction; this docstring kept the
    tempting story, which is the same "establish it, then write it" failure one layer down.

    The first `# ` heading in a document is its title by convention, so a group heading is any *later*
    one. A section with no group returns None and the caller says so out loud rather than inventing a
    name — naming a group (who reported it, when) is editorial, the same reason the contents line is
    not generated either.
