"""Claude Code UserPromptSubmit hook: arm wake-on-suggestions.sh when a prompt cites the runbook.

The triage seat is the session pointed at the runbook, so citing it in a prompt, in any wording, is
what arms the watcher, and the watcher belongs to that session and no other. RUNBOOK names the file to
look for (default TRIAGE_LOOP.md); FILE names the inbox, as it does for watch-suggestions.sh. This is
the gist copy with the wrapper's name changed; a change to the pattern goes back to the gist. Register it
in the repo's committed .claude/settings.json (this repo's entry is in docs/CONSUMER_TRIAGE_LOOP.md §2):

    {"hooks": {"UserPromptSubmit": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "timeout": 10,
      "command": "FILE=\\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/docs/INBOX.md\\" python3 \\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/tools/arm-on-prompt.py\\""}]}]}}

Never blocks. Prints one line to stdout, which Claude Code adds to the turn, saying what it did.
