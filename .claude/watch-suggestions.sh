# Debounced watcher for the consumer-suggestion triage loop. See docs/CONSUMER_TRIAGE_LOOP.md.
#
# Emits one line on stdout when the watched file has stopped changing for COOLDOWN seconds.
# Consecutive saves inside the cooldown collapse into a single event, because each mtime bump restarts
# the timer. Meant to be driven by whatever turns a line of stdout into a notification — the Monitor
# tool here, but it works piped to anything.
#
# It never fires for a change that predates it: `last` is seeded from the current mtime and `dirty`
# starts clear, so an already-settled edit stays quiet. Run the ledger once at startup to pick up
# whatever is already pending.
#
# COOLDOWN is sized for an agent author, not a human one. When reports are written through an agent the
# pattern is a burst of edits — five in a minute is normal — with gaps wherever the agent stops to read
# or probe something. A one-minute timer fires in the middle of such a run and triages half a report.
# 150s clears the pauses that show up in practice. The only cost of waiting is latency; the cost of
# firing early is a reply to a half-written item.
#
# Nothing needs installing: `stat` polling is enough at this cadence, and it works where inotify-tools,
# entr, fswatch and python watchdog are all absent.
#
# This is the only one of the three that is really bash. The ledger is Python and is invoked through
# $PYTHON below rather than as a bare path, so neither its exec bit nor its shebang is load-bearing
# (docs/CONSUMER_TRIAGE_LOOP.md §5 — the extension gotcha).
