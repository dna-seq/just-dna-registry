# Debounced watcher for the consumer-suggestion triage loop. See docs/CONSUMER_TRIAGE_LOOP.md.
#
# Emits one line on stdout when the watched file has stopped changing for COOLDOWN seconds.
# Consecutive saves inside the cooldown collapse into a single event, because each mtime bump restarts
# the timer. Meant to be driven by whatever turns a line of stdout into a notification — a background
# task here, but it works piped to anything.
#
# It never fires for a change that predates it: `last` is seeded from the current mtime and `dirty`
# starts clear, so an already-settled edit stays quiet. Run the ledger once at startup to pick up
# whatever is already pending.
#
# COOLDOWN is sized for an agent author, not a human one. When reports are written through an agent the
# pattern is a burst of edits — five in a minute is normal — with gaps wherever the agent stops to read
# or probe something. A one-minute timer fires in the middle of such a run and triages half a report.
# 150s clears the pauses that show up in practice. The only cost of waiting is latency; the cost of
# firing early is a reply to a half-written item.
#
# Nothing needs installing: `stat` polling is enough at this cadence, and it works where inotify-tools,
# entr, fswatch and python watchdog are all absent.
#
# If your triage pass is permitted to commit, it should only watch while the tree is on the branch
# that permit covers: a feature branch — or a detached HEAD — is somebody's own work, and unattended
# triage commits would land on top of whatever they are mid-way through. Off that branch the watcher
# idles at BRANCH_PAUSE instead of POLL, says so once, and says so again when it resumes. It does not
# touch `last` while paused, so an edit written during the pause is still picked up on the way back
# rather than lost. Set BRANCH to your own name for it, or to the empty string to switch the whole
# behaviour off; outside a git work tree there is no branch to speak of and it never pauses.
#
# One watcher per watched file, and the newest wins. Arming it again replaces the running one instead
# of adding a second: the older watcher belongs to an earlier run of the agent, so it notifies nobody who
# is listening, and two live watchers report every settle twice. The key is the watched file's resolved
# path, so a sibling repo's watcher is a different key and is never touched. A pidfile names the owner.
# On start the watcher records itself there and stops the previous owner, but only after checking that
# pid's command line, because a recycled pid could belong to anything. Every poll it checks the pidfile
# and exits if it no longer owns it. That exit is what settles two watchers started in the same second,
# and it also covers an old watcher whose kill was refused. No flock is used, because macOS has none.
#
# A replaced watcher exits with SUPERSEDED (3), whether it noticed at a poll or was sent TERM by its
# successor. It is the one exit that is neither an event nor a fault, and whoever armed it should be able
# to tell it apart from both without reading anything: a wrapper that ends in `wait` on this process
# reports 3 as the task's status. A TERM or INT while this watcher still owns the pidfile is somebody
# stopping it on purpose, and exits 0. Any other non-zero status is a real failure.
#
# This is the only one of the three that is really bash. The ledger is Python and is invoked through
# $PYTHON below rather than as a bare path, so neither its exec bit nor its shebang is load-bearing
# (docs/CONSUMER_TRIAGE_LOOP.md §5 — the extension gotcha).
