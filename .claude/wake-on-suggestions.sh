# Claude Code only: runs watch-suggestions.sh detached and wakes the session through its inbox socket.
#
# Claude Code stops every background task it owns after a deadline (2.1.285: 30 min by default,
# 2 h at most; its Monitor tool: 30 min), so the one-shot arming in docs/CONSUMER_TRIAGE_LOOP.md §2 dies on a
# timer there. This runs outside the harness and posts each settle as a user message to the
# session's own inbox socket, $CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET, which Claude Code exports to every hook
# and Bash command. An idle session starts a new turn when one arrives.
#
# The socket and its auth line are documented
# (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cross-session-messaging); the message line is not. The shape used
# here, {"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":...}}, is taken from Claude Code's own help
# text. ARMED_NOTICE=1 posts one "armed" line first, and that line is the live check: if an update
# changes the format, the arming turn sees no notice, rather than a reporter's item waiting unseen.
#
# It keeps watching after each event, so nothing needs re-arming. It ends when the watcher ends
# (superseded by a newer arming, exit 3, or stopped), or when the socket is gone, which is what a
# closed session leaves behind. A /clear keeps the process and the socket, so it survives that.
# Every env knob of watch-suggestions.sh (FILE, COOLDOWN, POLL, BRANCH, ...) passes through.
#
# This is the gist copy (wake-on-inbox.sh there) with the watcher's name and the runbook path
# changed; a change to the pattern goes back to the gist.
#
# Arm it from a hook (arm-on-prompt.py), never from the agent: auto mode's classifier refuses to let
# a session launch something that wakes itself, and a hook is not classified.
