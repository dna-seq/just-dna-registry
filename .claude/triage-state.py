"""Ledger for the consumer-suggestion triage loop. See docs/CONSUMER_TRIAGE_LOOP.md.

Reports, per top-level `## <PREFIX><n>` section of an inbox document, whether it has been triaged —
and if it was, whether the reporter has revised it since.

**The document is the ledger.** A triaged section carries, inside its reply, a marker holding a
fingerprint of the reporter's own text:

    <!-- triaged: 0.12.1 · sha 43031f8f63b3 -->

The fingerprint excludes the reply and the marker, so it covers what the reporter wrote and never what
you answered. Re-running after your own write is therefore a no-op, which is what stops a file watcher
firing forever.

Verdicts:
    new             no marker, no reply       -> triage it
    unmarked-reply  replied before the marker -> backfill the marker (see --backfill)
    revised         marker, fingerprint moved -> the reporter edited an answered item, re-triage
    current         marker matches            -> nothing to do

Configuration (environment, all optional):
    INBOX     path to the live document           (default docs/CONSUMER_SUGGESTIONS.md)
    HISTORY   path to the answered-items document (default alongside INBOX, *_HISTORY.md)
    PREFIX    item id prefix                      (default S, so `## S12 — …`)

The defaults point at this repo; everything else is the generalized gist copy
(<https://gist.github.com/winternewt/54b94bda01812be937b892146d1bb254>), so a change to the *pattern*
goes back there and a change to these paths does not. The trailing-rule normalization in `fingerprint`
was found here and went back to the gist on 2026-08-16; the two copies agree apart from the paths.

Python, and named `.py` for it: run it, or pass it to `python3` — never to `bash`. Under bash the
shebang is ignored, this docstring is executed as commands, and `import hashlib` reaches ImageMagick's
`import`. See the extension gotcha in docs/CONSUMER_TRIAGE_LOOP.md §5.

Usage:
    .claude/triage-state.py [path] [--pending] [--backfill]
    .claude/triage-state.py --next        # the next unclaimed id, over the inbox AND the history file
