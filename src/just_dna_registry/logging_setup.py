"""
Logging configuration. `REGISTRY_DEBUG=true` turns everything up to DEBUG on stdout so a live
server's console/journal shows exactly what happened — request tracing, the compiler/duckdb/uvicorn
internals, and the Eliot-structured publish/import steps.

Eliot messages (the app's structured action logs) are bridged into stdlib logging at DEBUG level,
so they surface only when debug is on and share one stdout stream with everything else.
