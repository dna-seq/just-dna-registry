"""
Capability-based RBAC vocabulary (0.9.0). Pure — no DB, no FastAPI — so it is unit-testable and
importable by both `api/deps.py` (the live resolver) and `cli.py`.

Roles are hierarchical: **owner ⊃ admin ⊃ member** (root/group/user). They are assignable at the org
level (cascading to every namespace the org owns) and per-namespace; the effective role on a
namespace is the *highest* of the two (see `higher_role` + `deps.effective_role`).

  member : publish; amend-OWN; yank/unyank-OWN            (own = versions this account authored)
  admin  : member + amend/yank ANY across the namespace + manage namespaces + manage members + curate
  owner  : admin  + assign roles + manage settings (incl. the funding link)

`*_ANY` vs `*_OWN`: routers demand the ANY capability and pass the resource's author; the resolver
downgrades to the OWN variant when the caller authored the resource (see `deps.require_capability`).
